You are an expert full-stack engineer.
Build a complete production-ready web app called Field Studies Trip Manager — a tool for managing Field Studies overnight trips.
Use Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and integrate with Airtable and the OpenAI API.

🏗️ Purpose

Field Studies is a student-led outdoor organization at Cal Poly SLO that runs hiking, backpacking, and climbing trips.
Trip leads need a secure internal dashboard where they can:

Log in (simple shared password for now)

View upcoming trips (from Airtable)

Select their trip

Manage rosters:

Randomize signups between drivers and non-drivers

Add someone from the waitlist

Drop someone from the roster

(Bonus) Chat with an AI assistant that can perform the same actions by command (e.g., “randomize Yosemite roster”).

⚙️ Tech Stack

Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router)

Language: TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Database: Airtable API (REST)

AI: OpenAI API (Assistant mode)

Hosting ready: Works on Vercel/Replit (port 3000)

Auth: One shared password for now (fieldstudies2025), with localStorage session persistence

Environment variables:

AIRTABLE_API_KEY

AIRTABLE_BASE_ID

AIRTABLE_TRIPS_TABLE

AIRTABLE_SIGNUPS_TABLE

OPENAI_API_KEY

🔐 Login Page (app/page.tsx)

Client component.

Displays password input centered on screen.

Correct password (fieldstudies2025) unlocks access to the Dashboard.

Store login state in localStorage so reloads remain logged in.

If logged in → show Dashboard.

Tailwind UI: gradient background, white frosted card, green CTA button.

🧭 Dashboard (components/Dashboard.tsx)

Client component that fetches trips from /api/airtable/trips.

Displays trips in responsive cards with:

Trip name

Dates

Status (Open / Waitlist)

“Manage Trip” button → /trip/[tripId]

Uses useRouter() for navigation.

Loading and error states.

🧩 Trip Details Page (app/trip/[tripId]/page.tsx)

Client component.

Fetches that trip’s signup data from Airtable (Trip Signups table).

Displays:

Trip name + date

Roster list

Waitlist list

Driver count

Buttons:

“Randomize Roster” → POST to /api/airtable/randomize

“Add From Waitlist” → POST to /api/airtable/addFromWaitlist

“Drop Participant” → POST to /api/airtable/dropParticipant

Includes a <ChatBox /> component (OpenAI assistant).

Button actions update Airtable via API routes and revalidate UI.

📡 API Endpoints

Each endpoint uses the Airtable REST API with fetch.

/api/airtable/trips/route.ts (GET)

Fetch all trips from AIRTABLE_TRIPS_TABLE.
Return id, Trip Name, Start Date, End Date, Status.

/api/airtable/randomize/route.ts (POST)

Input: { tripId: string }

Fetch signups for that trip.

Randomly select the correct number of drivers and non-drivers.

Update Airtable roster fields.

Return { success: true, randomizedRoster: [...] }.

/api/airtable/addFromWaitlist/route.ts (POST)

Input: { tripId: string }

Move the next person from waitlist → roster in Airtable.

/api/airtable/dropParticipant/route.ts (POST)

Input: { tripId: string, participantName: string }

Remove participant from Airtable roster.

/api/ai/chat/route.ts (POST)

Input: { tripId, message }

Calls OpenAI with context:

You are a trip management assistant for Field Studies.
You can randomize rosters, add waitlist participants, or drop people.


Parses natural language commands to trigger Airtable API endpoints.

Returns an AI-generated message summarizing the result.

🧰 Utility Files
lib/airtable.ts

Reusable functions:

fetchTrips()

fetchTripSignups(tripId)

updateRoster(tripId, newRoster)

moveFromWaitlist(tripId)

dropParticipant(tripId, name)

lib/ai.ts

Reusable OpenAI call helper using fetch to POST to /api/ai/chat.

💬 ChatBox (components/ChatBox.tsx)

Client component.

Fixed panel on trip page bottom.

Input field + “Send” button.

Sends chat to /api/ai/chat → shows conversation history.

Tailwind styles: rounded panel, green accent.

🚀 Deployment readiness

Fully typed (TypeScript strict mode).

.env.example with required keys.

Use environment variables for Airtable + OpenAI keys.

Works locally (npm run dev) and deploys cleanly to Replit/Vercel.

No hardcoded API keys.

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Visit / → login page → enter password → see dashboard.

Dashboard loads live trips from Airtable.

Clicking “Manage Trip” → /trip/[tripId].

Trip details show real signups.

Randomize/Add/Drop buttons update Airtable via API routes.

Chatbox accepts messages like “Randomize roster” and performs that action using AI + API routes.

UI updates instantly after each action.

💡 Stretch Goals (optional)

Add Clerk or Firebase authentication instead of password.

Add email notifications via Resend or Brevo when rosters change.

Add “Trip History” view for completed trips.

Support multiple branches (Cal Poly, Oregon State).

🪄 Final Notes for Replit

Generate all code for this app, including:

All components, pages, and routes listed above

Tailwind configuration

TypeScript types

Proper environment variable loading

Clean UI (Tailwind classes only)

Use placeholders for AIRTABLE_* and OPENAI_API_KEY, with .env.example generated.

Expected result:
A fully working Field Studies Trip Manager web app with login, Airtable integration, roster management actions, and an OpenAI-powered assistant that can perform trip management tasks.
